    <h1>wild life protection act 1927</h1>
    <fieldset>
    <h3>Introduction to the Act</h3>
    <p>The Act aims to conserve protected species of wildlife through two primary mechanisms: 1)
        prohibiting the hunting of all protected species and providing for strict regulation of their
        possession, transport and trade; and 2) safeguarding wildlife habitat by providing for the
        creation and management of protected areas (sanctuaries, National Parks, conservation reserves
        and community reserves1).

        The Act does not allow for hunting / capture of any animal species once included on any one of
        Schedules I-IV.2
        There are few exceptions to this rule in the nature of permits to hunt an animal
        which has become diseased or dangerous to human life or property3
        or for scientific research,
        etc.4
        The Act does not provide for a sustainable use model, whereby hunting (including capture)
        of a listed species is regulated / managed for subsistence or commercial use. Once a species is
        listed in Schedules I-IV, hunting (including capture) of such species is banned, and the
        possession and trade of such species (including derivatives in the form of trophies and articles)
        is strictly regulated.5

        Broadly speaking, offences under the Act can be divided into three categories:<br><br>
        1) <b>Offence of Hunting (or Picking, Uprooting, etc., of Specified Plants) </b>– S. 9, 17A, and 2(16)<br>

        2) <b>Offences relating to Unauthorized Possession, Transport and Trade </b>- Sections 40, 42,
        43, 44, 48, 48A, and 49, and Chapter V-A<br>

        3) <b>xOffences relating to Protected Areas/Habitat Destruction</b> – Sections 27, 29, 30, 31, 32,
        33-A, 34, 35(6), 35(7), 35(8), 36-A(2), 36-C(2), and 38-V(2). <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Discussion of the Act with Reference to Important Judicial Decisions</h3>
    <b>Definitions</b>
    <p>“In fact, the acceptance of the plea of the petitioner to the effect that the definition of
        'animal article' would exclude 'hair' merely because of the definition of 'trophy' including
        'hair' within its sweep would lead to an absurd result proscribed by the above judgments
        of the Hon'ble Supreme Court…… In our view, the definitions of 'uncured trophy', 'trophy'
        and 'Scheduled animal article' are not separate, distinct and exclusive compartments but
        are complementary to one another. Any other construction would defeat the object of the
        Act and the intention of the Legislature.”</p><br>
    <b>Hunting</b>
    <p>“In the opinion of this Court, a damage caused to the wild life even if the same cannot be
        evaluated or calculated in terms of money is definitely a loss to the ecology and as a result
        thereof, it can be considered to be a loss to the public and society at large… It is the firm
        opinion of this Court that by the act of using fire arms for killing wild life, the accused
        committed the offence of mischief as defined in Sections 425 and 429 IPC. Since the
        Clause Thirdly of Section 141 IPC covers in its ambit, mischief, criminal trespass or other
        offence..., the provision of Section 141 IPC can very well be applied to an offence of
        mischief when committed in relation to a wild animal also. Accordingly, the term 'other
        offence' as mentioned in Section 141 covers in its ambit, an offence under Wild Life
        Protection Act. Therefore, every member of the unlawful assembly which participates in
        the act of hunting is definitely liable for being prosecuted for the offence under Section 51
        of the Wild Life Protection Act with the aid of Section 149 IPC.”<br>
        One of the grey areas involving hunting is the case of accidental deaths of wild animals, or cases
        where there is an absence of mens rea to hunt. Despite the fact that such cases are often
        registered by State Forest Departments, it is unlikely that the offence under Section 9 applies to
        such cases and there does not appear to be any higher court judgment on this issue. Accordingly,
        there may be a need to include a separate offence in the Act with a lower punishment to deal
        with cases where wild animals are killed due to rash or negligent conduct. </p>
    <b>Protected Areas</b>
    <p>Chapter IV of the Act deals with the creation and protection of Protected Areas. Sections 27 to
        33-A, and Section 34 set out the acts and omissions which are offences in relation to sanctuaries.
        Many of these provisions are applicable to National Parks as well by virtue of Section 35(8).
        Section 29 is a general provision prohibiting destruction or damage to wildlife or its habitat in
        sanctuaries. Section 35(6) is the corresponding provision for National Parks. For any departure
        from Sections 29 or 35, a permit is required from the Chief Wild Life Warden, which is only to
        be granted after authorization by the State Government. As per these provisions, such permit is
        to be authorized only after the State Government has consulted with the State Board for Wild
        Life (for sanctuaries) or the National Board for Wild Life (for National Parks). However, these
        statutory provisions have been added to by the Supreme Court, and as a result of its orders dated
        9 May 2002 in Center for Environmental Law, WWF India v. Union of India (Writ Petition
        (Civil) No. 337 of 1995), and 4 December 2006 in Goa Foundation v. Union of India (Writ
        Petition (Civil) No. 460 of 2004), any non-forest activity falling within sanctuaries, National
        Parks, and 10 kilometers of their boundaries now requires prior consultation with the Standing
        Committee of the National Board for Wild Life</p>
    <b>Seizure, Confiscation, and Forfeiture of Property</b>
    <p>This area of the Act has seen much litigation before higher courts, mostly by owners of vehicles
        which have been confiscated for their alleged use in offences under the Act. Under Section
        50(1)(c) of the Act, certain officers are given the power to seize items, either in respect of which
        an offence has been committed (such as captive animals, animal articles etc.), or which have
        been used for the commission of an offence (such as traps, tools, vehicles, etc.). As per Section
        50(4) of the Act, such things seized are to be taken forthwith before a magistrate to be dealt with
        according to law. Under Section 51(2) of the Act, while convicting a person of an offence under
        the Act, a court may order that any such item is forfeited to the State Government. <br>
        Some confusion is caused by Section 39(1) of the Act which states that certain items (such as
        captive animals, animal articles, etc.) in respect of which an offence has been committed under
        the Act, and certain other items (such as traps, tools, vehicles, etc.) which have been used for the
        commission of an offence under the Act, shall be the property of the State Government.<br>
        The above view was reiterated by the Supreme Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Madhukar
        Rao 2008 (14) SCC 624 where the court observed: <br>
        <i>“We have, therefore, no doubt that the provisions of Section 50 of the Act and the
            amendments made thereunder do not in any way affect the Magistrate s power to make an
            order of interim release of the vehicle under Section 451 of the Code… Any attempt to
            operationalise Article 39(1)(d) of the Act merely on the basis of seizure and
            accusations/allegations leveled by the departmental authorities would bring it into conflict
            with the constitutional provisions and would render it unconstitutional and invalid. In our
            opinion, the High Court has taken a perfectly correct view and the provisions of Section
            39(1)(d) cannot be used against exercise of the Magisterial power to release the vehicle
            during pendency of the trial.”

        List of National Parks In India</b>
    <p>A state-wise list of National Parks is mentioned below for the benefit of candidates.
        As per our experts, the location-based question on the List Of National Parks is one of the
        most prominent questions in examinations like - UPSC CSE, NDA, and CDS examination. Even in a state-level
        competitive
        examination, national parks along with their location are asked in the examination.
        Candidates must also prepare important flora and fauna associated with these National Parks.<br>1.There are 106
        National Parks and 568 Wildlife Sanctuaries in India.
        <br>2.
        They account for 1.35% of the geographical area of the country.<br>
        3.Madhya Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands have the maximum number of National Parks (9 each).
